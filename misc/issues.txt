Issues regarding JAXR-RI

Question: how many issues lists do we have?


GUI Issues:
-How should we wrap long descriptions?
-Replace text with icons for buttons later.
-Check Java Look and Feel guidlines.
-How should browser handle bad username/password?
(does setCredential() throw an exception?)
-When submitting an existing org, should prompt for submitting
over existing one (delete first) or submitting new one. Should
be able to tell if it exists already if there's a key (maybe).
-Key info not getting into edit panel for services after an
organization is submitted to registry.

Logging:
Should init() methos of Log.java be synchronized?

General:
should move proxy info from command line into
the jaxr.properties file.

-----------------------------------
UDDIMapper:
phones2TelephoneNumbers() needs to setPhoneType(String) after
the change to TelephoneNumberImpl is done.

JavaDoc:
way to timestamp generated javadoc?

Can we use SOAPHTTPConnection directly to send xml?

Overwrote ripoff.gif with trfolder.gif until the image can be fixed.
I'm keeping a backup of it myself (and it's in the jaxr workspace).
